# Dungeons & Damage
<p>This is an experimental rpg that will get updated as time goes on</p>
<p>Also there are no dungeons. It's a pvp game set in a gladiator arena</p>
<p>You can play as:</p>

### Knight
<p>A man who fought valiantly and for honor for his kingdom. Now, he’s been captured and put to fight in the arena. If he wins, he will be allowed to leave.</p>

### Peashooter
<p>No one knows how he came to be. He’s a plant that shoots peas out of his mouth. Some say he was made by a witch, others, god. No one knows, not even him</p>

### Mage
<p>A traveling mage who claims to have mastered magic as a whole. People were skeptical, so he decided to go to the gladiator fight and prove that he is a master of all things arcane</p>

### Rouge
<p>The rouge was caught stealing from the King. Because of this, the King sent the rouge to fight in the gladiator fight, one that he would be attending personally. If the rouge put on a good show, he and his family would get rewarded handsomely (only the family if he dies), and if he doesn’t, he will be executed</p>

### Skele
<p>One day, a pile of bones in a prisoner cell became animated. The people in charge of the prison saw this and thought, “Hey! Why don’t we just send him into the arena if he can’t die?”</p>

### Bard
<p>The bard is a barkeep at the local bar. He serves drinks, he plays songs, and he gets to know the regulars. One day, he made a bet with someone where the loser would go fight in the arena. Needless to say, he lost the bet</p>

### Barbarian
<p>The barbarian has no identity, so we can’t really give him a proper story, but he kinda just broke in to the arena for the thrill of the fight</p>
